Write a generic C++ to implement a binary search tree data structure, providing operations to
• create an empty tree
• insert a value into a tree
• delete a value from a tree
• search the tree for a given value by passing in a user-defined function to be applied to values in the tree; the function when applied to a value in the tree should return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the tree value is less than, equal to, or greater than the target,
• print a representation of the tree suitable for debugging, i.e. which should show both the content and structure of the tree.
Write a simple test harness that interactively prompts the user for an operation and any relevant data, performs the operation, and displays the result.
