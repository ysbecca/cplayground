My C++ playground


Prior to this 2016, I have always used BitBucket with git, largely due to the fact that their Academic account allows free, unlimited private repositories. That was (and still is) great. Now that I am moving towards open sourcing my code, even if personal projects or playgrounds, I will try to give GitHub another chance.

Here is a collection of my exploring C++ from personal projects and self-learning while doing a MSc at the University of Leeds. To avoid plagarism issues, I will not include any coursework required for submission.
